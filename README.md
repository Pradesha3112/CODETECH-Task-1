Overview of the Project

project:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

Objectives:
*To automate the process of tracking student grades for multiple subjects.
*To calculate total, average, and letter grade efficiently.
*To provide a clear and tabulated report for better visualization.

Key Activities:
*Input Management:
  Accepts grades for multiple subjects while validating input to ensure the grade falls between 0 and 100.

*Computation:
  Calculates the total and average grades.
  Assigns a letter grade based on the average.

*Output:
  Displays a tabular report summarizing the subject-wise grades.
  Highlights the total, average, and final letter grade for quick analysis.

Technologies Used:
*Programming Language: Python
*Library: tabulate for structured tabular representation.

Key Insights:
*User-Friendly Validation: The program ensures input correctness by prompting users to re-enter invalid grades.
*Data Representation: Using the tabulate library makes the output more organized and visually appealing.
*Scalability: The approach can be extended to include more features like grade thresholds, class ranks, and exporting reports to files.

User Interaction Flow:
*User inputs the number of subjects.
*Provides subject names and corresponding grades.
*The program validates the inputs, calculates the total and average, and assigns a letter grade.
*The results are displayed in a clear tabular format.

Real-World Applications:

*Automating grade management for schools and colleges.
*Developing advanced academic performance dashboards.
*Personal grade tracking for self-assessment and improvement.
