Overview of the Project

project:STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

Objectives:
1.To automate the process of tracking student grades for multiple subjects.
2.To calculate total, average, and letter grade efficiently.
3.To provide a clear and tabulated report for better visualization.

Key Activities:
1.Input Management:
  Accepts grades for multiple subjects while validating input to ensure the grade falls between 0 and 100.

2.Computation:
  Calculates the total and average grades.
  Assigns a letter grade based on the average.

3.Output:
  Displays a tabular report summarizing the subject-wise grades.
  Highlights the total, average, and final letter grade for quick analysis.

Technologies Used:
1.Programming Language: Python
2.Library: tabulate for structured tabular representation.

Key Insights:
1.User-Friendly Validation: The program ensures input correctness by prompting users to re-enter invalid grades.
2.Data Representation: Using the tabulate library makes the output more organized and visually appealing.
3.Scalability: The approach can be extended to include more features like grade thresholds, class ranks, and exporting reports to files.

User Interaction Flow:
1.User inputs the number of subjects.
2.Provides subject names and corresponding grades.
3.The program validates the inputs, calculates the total and average, and assigns a letter grade.
4.The results are displayed in a clear tabular format.

Real-World Applications:
1.Automating grade management for schools and colleges.
2.Developing advanced academic performance dashboards.
3.Personal grade tracking for self-assessment and improvement.
